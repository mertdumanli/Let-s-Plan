# Let-s-Plan
This project is the project I am working on for the graduation project 2 course.
Front-end: React Native
Back-end: MongoDB
Let's plan is abbreviated and it's just the name of the project. It is a system where they can organize their holiday plans, live broadcast streaming plans, lesson plans with certain templates and add self-plans to the general data.
